            <p>Children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are individuals who have difficulties with cognitive and intellectual functioning. 
              These difficulties can impact their daily activities, including learning, communication, and personal care. IDD can be present from birth or may develop later 
              in life as a result of an injury or illness. <br>Some common difficulties associated with IDD <br> <br>1...Difficulty with language and communication: Children with IDD may have difficulty with speaking, understanding spoken language, and using gestures or signs 
              to communicate <br>2...Delays in motor development: Children with IDD may have difficulty with gross motor skills (such as walking and running) or fine motor skills 
              (such as writing or using utensils). <br>3...Learning disabilities: Children with IDD may have difficulties with learning and retaining new information, and may require specialized educational support. <br>
              4...Social and emotional challenges: Children with IDD may struggle with socializing and building relationships, and may have behavioral and emotional challenges. <br>5...Adaptive skills: Children with IDD may have difficulty with everyday tasks such as self-care, dressing, and personal hygiene. <br>It's crucial to remember that every kid with IDD has different issues, and both the degree and nature of those challenges can vary substantially.
              Many kids with IDD may live happy, meaningful lives with the correct care and treatment.
