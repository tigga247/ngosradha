                <p>Children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are individuals who have difficulties with cognitive and intellectual functioning. 
                  These difficulties can impact their daily activities, including learning, communication, and personal care. IDD can be present from birth or may develop later 
                  in life as a result of an injury or illness. <br>Some common difficulties associated with IDD <br> <br>1...Difficulty with language and communication: Children with IDD may have difficulty with speaking, understanding spoken language, and using gestures or signs 
                  to communicate <br>2...Delays in motor development: Children with IDD may have difficulty with gross motor skills (such as walking and running) or fine motor skills 
                  (such as writing or using utensils). <br>3...Learning disabilities: Children with IDD may have difficulties with learning and retaining new information, and may require specialized educational support. <br>
                  4...Social and emotional challenges: Children with IDD may struggle with socializing and building relationships, and may have behavioral and emotional challenges. <br>5...Adaptive skills: Children with IDD may have difficulty with everyday tasks such as self-care, dressing, and personal hygiene. <br>It's crucial to remember that every kid with IDD has different issues, and both the degree and nature of those challenges can vary substantially.
                  Many kids with IDD may live happy, meaningful lives with the correct care and treatment.

          <h2>OUR PRIMARY <span>Issue</span></h2>
          <p>Children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) may have a range of challenges and issues, such as trouble communicating, interacting with others, and displaying adaptive behaviour. They could also struggle with fine and gross motor abilities, as well as scholastic activities and learning.
            Additionally, emotional and behavioural issues including anxiety, despair, and anger can affect children with IDD. Additionally, it may be difficult for kids with IDD to get the right kind of schooling, healthcare, and other assistance. To support children with IDD and help them reach their full potential, families, carers, and professionals must collaborate. Individualized education plans, counselling, and other treatments, along with promoting the use of the right resources, may all be part of this.</p>
